## Introduction  
This project implements a simulation of various TCP variants using the Network Simulator 2 (NS2). The TCP variants examined in this project include:  
- TCP Tahoe  
- TCP Reno  
- TCP NewReno  

The purpose of this simulation is to analyze the performance and behavior of these TCP variants under different network conditions.  

## TCP Variants  
### 1. TCP Tahoe  
- Description of TCP Tahoe and its features.  
### 2. TCP Reno  
- Description of TCP Reno and its improvements over Tahoe.  
### 3. TCP New Reno  
- Description of TCP New Reno and its handling of packet loss.  

## Prerequisites  
Before running the simulations, ensure that you have the following installed:  
- [Network Simulator 2 (NS2)](http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/)  
- Necessary tools and dependencies for NS2 like xgraph, etc.

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:  

   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tcp-variants-simulation.git  
   cd tcp-variants-simulation  
   ```
